# This is a number guessing game ran through python.
# The player has a choice of three difficulties, easy, medium, and hard.
# The range for each difficulty starts at 1 and goes up to 10, 25, and 50, respectively.
# For each difficulty the player has five guesses.
# There is error prevention in place when selecting a difficulty so any invalid selection will not cause an error and prompt the player to enter a difficulty again.
# ValueError occurs if a non integer is sent as a guess. Im not sure how to fix this yet but I will learn to.
# If a player loses, (runs out of guesses,) the secret number will be revealed to them.
